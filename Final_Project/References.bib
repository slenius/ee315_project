abstract = {A 1.5-V, 10-bit, 14.3-MS/s pipeline analog-to-digital converter was implemented in a 0.6 {\&}mu;m CMOS technology. Emphasis was placed on observing device reliability constraints at low voltage. MOS switches were implemented without low-threshold devices by using a bootstrapping technique that does not subject the devices to large terminal voltages. The converter achieved a peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio of 58.5 dB, maximum differential nonlinearity of 11.5 least significant bit (LSB), maximum integral nonlinearity of 0.7 LSB, and a power consumption of 36 mW},

abstract = {A latch-type voltage sense amplifier in 90nm CMOS is designed with a separated input and cross-coupled stage. This separation enables fast operation over a wide common-mode and supply voltage range. With a 1-sigma offset of 8mV, the circuit consumes 92fJ/decision with a 1.2V supply. It has an input equivalent noise of 1.5mV and requires 18ps setup-plus-hold time},

abstract = {Analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is a vital component for modern electronic systems, but designing an ADC usually takes much time and effort. Though several synthesis methods have been presented for analog circuits, there exists limited works focusing on ADC design automation. In this paper, we propose a systematic sizing methodology to minimize the power consumption for successive approximation register (SAR) ADCs in transistor level. This method manipulates the characteristics of SAR ADC to develop an efficient searching algorithm for shortening the sizing time. The time complexity of our method is O(2 log<sub>2</sub> |S|), where jSj is the number of candidates in the searching space. According to the proposed sizing flow, we develop a sizing tool which is independent of manufacturing process and is able to minimize power consumption for SAR ADCs. By using the developed sizing tool, a proof-of-concept prototype was carried out within only 15 minutes and fabricated in a 1P4M 0.11{\&}{\#}x03BC;m process. The measurement results show the prototype demonstrates a high competitiveness compared to other state-of-the-art works on performance and power efficiency},

abstract = {SAR-ADC power efficiency has improved due to its digitally oriented nature that utilizes the high switching speed of nanometer CMOS processes. In recent reports, time-interleaving techniques and multi-bit-per-cycle conversion have boosted speed to the GHz sampling range at low power consumption. However, to achieve SNR of {\&}gt;70dB at moderate sampling speed, SARs still need a lot of power, namely tens of mW [1-2]. In [1], a very high SNR of 90dB is achieved by a stage to amplify residue charge, which is one of the reasons for the 105mW power consumption at 12.5MS/s. In [2], 8{\&}{\#}x00D7; oversampling and a static current pre-amplifier for the comparator improve SNR to 88dB, but the ADC still consumes 66mW. In [3], digital calibration achieves an SNDR of 71dB at 3mW, but double conversion limits the sampling speed to 22.5MS/s.This paper describes a SAR ADC with 71dB SNDR that runs at 50MS/s and consumes 4.2mW. The ADC uses 3 SNDR-enhancement techniques that utilize noise and that have good compatibility to low-voltage fine digital processes},

abstract = {In this paper, a 10b 0.5-to-4MS/s asynchronous SAR ADC is proposed and prototyped in 90nm CMOS. The supply voltage is scaled down appropriately (0.4 to 0.7V) for different speeds to minimize power consumption of SAR control and switching energy. Moreover, a charge average switching (CAS) DAC is developed to reduce the switching energy of the DAC without an extra voltage reference and common-mode shift. In near-threshold operation with a scaled-down supply, a double-boosted sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit and a local-boosted switch are implemented for the linearity and accuracy requirements of the 10b ADC},

abstract = {Current trends in analog/mixed-signal design for battery-powered devices demand the adoption of cheap and power-efficient ADCs. SAR architectures have been recently demonstrated as able to achieve high power efficiency in the moderate-resolution/medium- bandwidth range in Craninckx, J. and Van der Plas, G., (2007). However, when the comparator determines in first instance the overall performance, as in most SAR ADCs, comparator thermal noise can limit the maximum achievable resolution. More than 1 and 2 ENOB reductions are observed in Craninckx, J. and Van der Plas, G., (2007) and Kuttner, F., (2002), respectively, because of thermal noise, and degradations could be even worse with scaled supply voltages and the extensive use of dynamic regenerative latches without pre-amplification. Unlike mismatch, random noise cannot be compensated by calibration and would finally demand a quadratic increase in power consumption unless alternative circuit techniques are devised},
